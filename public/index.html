    <p>  Web design is a field that has moved at the speed of light in the last 25 years.
    The languages and conventions in web design are something that has evolved at
    at breakneck speed in this period of time. Formats and languages like Tables,
    JavaScript and Flash are tools that have developed and had to adapt in a flash
    with some of these formats and conventions flowndering in the process.</p>

    <p>An example of how the industry has moved quickly is the rise and near demise of Flash.
    Flash is a technology that came to give freedom, creativity and animation to the web
    in a way it did not have it before. However, due to the advent of the mobile internet
    the processing speed and capabilities needed to run Flash, it became the reason that Apple
    blocked its use in the iPhone. This small developement translated into Flash's near
    demise.</p>

    <p>Nowadays, in it's latest iteration Web Design has gone back to it's roots. With
    the more prevalent use of Responsive Web Design (merger of HTML & CSS), it has gone back
    to basics whilst highlighting content once again.
